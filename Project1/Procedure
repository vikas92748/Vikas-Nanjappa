Concept: Using Virtual private cloud (VPC), Creating a secured EC2 public and private instance

Subnets:
	Public subnet: Reachable from the internet, ideal for instances that need to be accessed externally (e.g., web servers).
	Private subnet: Isolated from the internet, more secure for critical resources (e.g., databases).

EC2 Instances:
	Launched in both public and private subnets based on their needs.

Jump Host:
	An EC2 instance placed in the public subnet.
	Serves as a stepping stone to access private instances. You connect to the jump host and then jump to the private instance.
	Improves security by not exposing private instances directly to the internet.

Benefits:
	Enhanced Security: Private instances are shielded from direct internet access.
	Controlled Access: Jump host acts as a single point of entry for managing private instances.
